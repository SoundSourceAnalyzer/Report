As a solution for genre recognition problem, authors propose fully connected 4-hidden-layer neural network built up on TensorFlow framework. Hidden layers consist of $1024$, $1024$, $256$ and $56$ nodes. High-level architecture of the Depp Neural Network is presented in Figure \ref{fig:dnn}. Learning rate decaying is used with parameters as in equation \ref{eq:rate_decay}.
\begin{equation}
learning\ rate = 0.3 \times 0.9^{\frac{step}{500}}
\label{eq:rate_decay}
\end{equation}
Moreover, dropout is used during training after each of the hidden layers on the level of $0.7$, which means that $30\%$ is dropped out. After input layer and $4$ hidden layers ReLU activation function is used, whereas Softmax with cross entropy is used after the output layer. The network is optimized using Gradient Descent algorithm. Initial weights are randomly selected from $\mathcal{N}(0,0.05)$ for hidden layers and $\mathcal{N}(0,0.1)$ for output layer. Initial biases are set to $0$.
