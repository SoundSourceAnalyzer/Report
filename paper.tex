\section{Introduction}
The field of digital audio processing is an interesting topic, broadly investigated in scientific research. Problems such as music genre or instrument classification have been sucessfully solved in the past with the use of traditional machine learning methods. In this paper we analyse the results of "ISMIS 2011 Contest: Music Information Retrieval/Music Genres", and try to improve the results achieved in that challange.

\section{Conclusions}

Results are partially satisfying. While a very good result on an established dataset from \cite{data} was obtained, an attempt to process raw sound database, such as in \cite{gztan} has failed to deliver good results. In order to decisively establish the legitimacy of the networks architecture further research is required. Validating against more datasets is desirable.
