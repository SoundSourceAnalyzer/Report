In the presented research authors investigated complete end to end solution for classic genre recognition problem. It is possible to improve the proposed approach in a the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
 \item more features can be extracted from audio files,
 \item RNN can be applied to features so that correlations between consecutive frames are better highlighted,
 \item frame overlapping can be applied,
 \item more regularization is needed to decrease batch overfitting.
\end{itemize}
Mentioned areas are going to be the subject of further investigation on the subject.
