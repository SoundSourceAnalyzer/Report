For experiments data from \cite{data} was used. Only Training dataset had labels, so it was randomly split in half, so that both the training and test datasets contained of $6248$ observations. Duplicate columns were dropped before feeding the neural network. After using different configuration settings training procedure was established on $3001$ steps with batches of size $128$ observations.  We have made experiments, tuning our neural network parameters and get $96.4\%$ accuracy on test data.
